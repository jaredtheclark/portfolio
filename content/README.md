# Portfolio Content Documentation

This folder contains all the text content from the portfolio website, organized by page for easy editing and iteration.

## Files

- **`homepage.md`** - Homepage content including hero section, project list, and Let's Connect section
- **`case-studies.md`** - Case studies index page with project cards and combined impact metrics
- **`car-mart-payments.md`** - Full America's Car-Mart case study content
- **`jcpenney-pos.md`** - Full JCPenney POS case study content

## How to Use

1. **Edit content** directly in these markdown files
2. **Copy sections** to the corresponding page components in the `app` directory
3. **Maintain consistency** in terminology and messaging across pages
4. **Update metrics** as new data becomes available

## Content Guidelines

- Keep case study titles outcome-focused
- Include specific metrics with context
- Balance "I" vs "We" appropriately (use "I" for personal contributions, "We" for team execution)
- Maintain Principal-level narrative voice
- Focus on business impact over design execution
- Ensure scannable structure (2-minute scan time, 30-second impact comprehension)
