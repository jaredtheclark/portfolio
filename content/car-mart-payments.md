## My Approach & Process

### Research & Discovery Phase

#### Jobs-to-Be-Done (JTBD) Workshop Leadership

- I led cross-functional stakeholders through structured JTBD methodology
- Collaborated with Business Analysts to facilitate ORCA workshop sessions
- **Core JTBD I Identified:** "When I process a payment I want a unified system to handle every payment method (cash, card, ACH, etc.) So that I don't rely on multiple programs or manual workarounds."
- This insight became the strategic foundation for the entire platform redesign

#### Custom UX Research Framework Development

- I created a comprehensive research kit tailored to auto finance context
- Conducted onsite contextual inquiry at multiple dealership locations
- Led stakeholder interviews with lot managers, associates, and customers
- Facilitated user testing sessions during prototype and build phases
- Developed persona framework based on real customer segments and payment behaviors

#### Strategic AI Integration & Team Enablement

- I pioneered generative AI adoption to accelerate research synthesis by 40%
- Developed AI-assisted wireframing process that maintained design quality standards
- Mentored senior designer in AI tool adoption, aligning with company leadership initiatives
- Created quality safeguards ensuring AI outputs met enterprise standards

### Design Strategy & Leadership

#### Design System Selection & Strategy

I evaluated and selected the appropriate design library to ensure team consistency and scalability. Established Figma-to-React component alignment strategy that reduced design-development handoff friction by 50%. Created comprehensive design-development workflow processes adopted across the organization.

#### Cross-Functional Collaboration & Influence

I translated JTBD insights into actionable user stories that development teams could execute. Built comprehensive product backlog in Azure DevOps with embedded design links and acceptance criteria. Established design quality standards and review processes that ensured consistency throughout development cycles.

## Key Learnings & Insights

### Design Strategy Insights

#### AI as Strategic Accelerator, Not Replacement

Successfully integrating AI tools into the design process required establishing clear quality gates and human oversight. I learned that AI excels at accelerating initial exploration and synthesis, but strategic design decisions still require human judgment and contextual understanding. The key was creating a framework where AI handled repetitive tasks while designers focused on strategic problem-solving. This approach increased our velocity by 40% while maintaining enterprise-grade quality standards.

#### JTBD as Foundation for Cross-Functional Alignment

Leading the JTBD workshop revealed how powerful this methodology is for creating shared understanding across business, technology, and design teams. The core job statement we identified became the north star for every design and development decision. I learned that investing time upfront in rigorous research methodology pays exponential dividends in reducing scope creep and maintaining strategic focus throughout implementation.

### Collaboration & Leadership Insights

#### Translating Design into Development Language

One of the most impactful aspects of this project was learning to bridge the gap between design artifacts and development execution. By embedding design links directly into Azure DevOps user stories and creating detailed acceptance criteria, I reduced back-and-forth questions by 60%. This taught me that Principal-level design work isn't just about creating beautiful interfaces—it's about creating systems and processes that enable teams to execute with confidence.

#### Stakeholder Management in Regulated Industries

Working in auto finance required balancing user needs with strict compliance requirements and business constraints. I learned that successful stakeholder management means understanding each group's priorities and finding solutions that serve multiple objectives. The autopay feature, for example, addressed customer convenience, business revenue stability, and compliance tracking simultaneously. This multi-stakeholder value creation is essential for Principal-level impact.

### Technical & Domain Insights

#### Legacy System Integration Complexity

Replacing three legacy payment systems while maintaining business continuity taught me the importance of phased rollouts and comprehensive testing strategies. I learned to design with migration paths in mind, creating interfaces that could gracefully handle both old and new system states during transition periods. This experience reinforced that enterprise design requires thinking beyond the ideal end state to consider the messy reality of implementation.

#### Designing for Financial Accessibility

Working with buy-here-pay-here customers revealed unique challenges around financial literacy and technology access. I learned to design payment interfaces that were simple enough for users with limited digital experience while still providing the sophistication needed for complex financial transactions. This balance between simplicity and capability is a design challenge that extends far beyond this project and has shaped my approach to inclusive design.
