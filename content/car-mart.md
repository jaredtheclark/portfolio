America's Car-Mart Payments Platform
Principal UX Architect · Enterprise Payments Modernization · 2025

The Outcome
Launched a zero-to-one payments platform in four months—on a timeline leadership said couldn't be done—achieving 200% increase in autopay enrollment while blocking a C-level directive that would have broken the customer experience.

The Situation
America's Car-Mart operates 150+ dealerships serving 100,000+ customers with in-house financing. Their payments infrastructure was fractured across multiple legacy systems with no unified source of truth.
I was brought in to architect the UX strategy for an enterprise-wide payments modernization. Eight weeks in, leadership pivoted: ship a customer-facing payments platform by June 1, or miss a critical financial audit window.
The scope collapsed from "transform everything" to "launch or else."

What I Did
Reframed the problem under pressure. When the timeline compressed, I carved out the customer-critical Jobs to Be Done from the broader research and built a focused product strategy that could actually ship.
Enabled a team to move fast without breaking things. Before my senior designer joined, I stood up the design system, documented the workflow, and synthesized each requirement with business and technical context. They delivered a working demo by the end of week one.
Held the line when it mattered. When the CTO bypassed our process to push a deceptive pattern directly to development, I intervened. I uncovered the actual business need behind the ask, designed a solution that served both customers and the business goal, and built the executive communication strategy to sell it. The result: 200% higher adoption than projected—without the dark pattern.
Validated with real users, not assumptions. Coached the team through usability studies with store managers, customer service associates, and actual customers. We recorded sessions and used the findings to reinforce design decisions to skeptical stakeholders.

Results

200% increase in autopay enrollment
15% growth in active online portal users post-launch
4-month delivery from kickoff to production (Jan–May 2025)
Zero data loss during payment system migration
Expanded engagement: Both myself and the designer I brought in were requested for additional high-visibility projects
